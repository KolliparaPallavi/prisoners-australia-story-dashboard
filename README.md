# Prisoners in Australia: Storytelling Dashboard
This project is an interactive data storytelling dashboard that explores the landscape of Australia’s prison population from 2013 to 2023. Using open data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the dashboard visualizes trends across states and territories, including gender and age distribution, indigenous status, types of offences, sentencing patterns, and unsentenced prisoners.
The aim of this dashboard is to present complex data in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format for a wide audience, including researchers, policymakers, and the general public. Built with R, Flexdashboard, and Plotly, it combines maps, bar charts, and interactive visualizations to provide a comprehensive view of Australia’s prison system and highlight demographic and sentencing trends over the past decade.
Explore the dashboard here https://rpubs.com/PallaviKollipara/1195701 and gain insights into patterns and disparities within the prison population, helping to inform discussions and policy decisions around justice and rehabilitation.
